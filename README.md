# Turtles
Turtle Emotes for everyone \o/

## Welcome to the official Turtle Emotes Server Github-Repo
Here you can find all the versions of the different emotes (SVG and PNG as well as templates) if given!

Thanks for stopping by!
## You want to submit your own emote and want to do it over github? You want to edit an emote?
Just make a pull request and explain why you want your changes to be saved! (Sometimes quite hard to identify on a small picture)
